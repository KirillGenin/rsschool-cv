<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I have been interested in website development for many years. I have created websites both for myself and for sale. On personal sites, I placed sponsored links and contextual advertising. I filled sites for sale with unique content. In both cases, I used content management systems - CMS. Although I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p>
Currently I want to learn how to build websites from scratch using HTML+CSS+JavaScript+React. My goal is to get a job in a big IT company where I can develop my skills and find many new like-minded people.
